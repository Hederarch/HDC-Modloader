# Hyperspace Deck Command Modding
This is an unofficial repository collecting information for reverse-engineering and modifying Hyperspace Deck Command by Sleeper Games. 
For now, most activity should be contained to the [wiki](https://github.com/Hederarch/HDC-Modloader/wiki) page as this is still in very exploratory phases.

## Rules
As per an official statement by Sleeper Games, modding must not:
- Distribute or allow the distribution of copies of HDC
  - It's a very cheap game by a very small developer. Piracy is not justifiable or desirable here.
- Publicly upload game assets or code
  - See above. 
- Violate the Sleeper Games Code of Conduct
  - i.e. promote hate speech or discrimination, include adult material, or distribute personal information
- Bother Sleeper Games directly.
  - This is a fan project and should be kept among fans. Sleeper Games is busy and is not expected to help.
